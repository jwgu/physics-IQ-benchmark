# Physics-IQ: Benchmarking physical understanding in generative video models

Physics-IQ is a high-quality, realistic, and comprehensive benchmark dataset for evaluating physical understanding in generative video models.

Project website: [physics-iq.github.io](https://physics-iq.github.io/)

### Key Features:
- **Real-world videos**: All videos are captured with high-quality cameras, not rendered.
- **Diverse scenarios**: Covers a wide range of physical phenomena, including collisions, fluid dynamics, gravity, material properties, light, shadows, magnetism, and more.
- **Multiple perspectives**: Each scenario is filmed from 3 different angles.
- **Variations**: Each scenario is recorded twice to capture natural physical variations.
- **High resolution and frame rate**: Videos are recorded at 3840 × 2160 resolution and 30 frames per second.

*Note to early adopters of the benchmark: results from the paper were finalized on February 19, 2025; if you used the toolbox before please re-run since we changed and improved a few aspects. Likewise, if you downloaded the dataset before that date, it is recommended to re-download it, ensuring the ground truth video masks have a duration of five seconds.*

## Step A: Generating Videos for Physics-IQ Test Cases Based on Video Model

### 1. Download Benchmark Dataset

Visit the [Google Cloud Storage link](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/physics-iq-benchmark) to download the dataset, or install gcloud SDK from [here](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk) and run the following:

```bash
python3 ./code/download_physics_iq_data.py
```

- If your desired FPS already exists in the dataset, it will be downloaded.
- If it does not exist, the script will download 30 FPS files and generate your desired FPS videos by downsampling the 30 FPS version.

---

### 2. Running Video Model on Test Cases from Benchmark

This section explains how to generate videos using the provided benchmark and save them in the required format. Follow the instructions below based on your model type:

#### 2.1 Image-to-Video Models (I2V)

<details>
  <summary>I2V steps</summary>

1. **Input Requirements**:
   - **Initial Frame**: Use frames from `physics-iq-benchmark/switch-frames`.
   - **Text Input (Optional)**: If required, use descriptions from `descriptions.csv`. Only the first 198 entries (marked as`take-1`) need to be used, feel free to ignore the `take-2` entries since they're not used for sampling from models. 

2. **Steps to Run**:
   - Generate videos using the initial frame (and text condition, if applicable).
   - Save generated videos in the following structure, using any filename as long as the unique ID prefix from the test videos is kept (`0001_`, ..., `0198_`):
     ```
     .model_name/{ID}_{anything-you-like}.mp4
     ```
   - Refer to the `generated_video_name` column in `descriptions.csv` for file naming conventions.

</details>

#### 2.2 Multiframe-to-Video Models (V2V)

<details>
  <summary>V2V steps</summary>

1. **Input Requirements**:
   - **Conditioning Frames**:
     - Available in `physics-iq-benchmark/split-videos/conditioning-videos`.
     - Ensure the correct frame rate: `30FPS`, `24FPS`, `16FPS`, or `8FPS`.
   - **Text Input (Optional)**: Use `descriptions.csv`.

2. **Steps to Run**:
   - Use conditioning frames to generate videos.
   - Save generated videos in the structure:
     ```
     model_name/{ID}_{perspective}_{scenario_name}.mp4
     example: model_name/{0001}_{perspective-left}_{trimmed-ball-and-block-fall}.mp4
     ```
   - Refer to the `generated_video_name` column in `descriptions.csv` for file naming conventions.

</details>

#### 2.3 Trim Generated Videos to 5 Seconds

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Before running the evaluation, you must trim all generated videos to **exactly 5 seconds**. Videos of any other duration are incompatible with the benchmark. If you're running V2V (=multiframe-to-video), please make sure you're not including the 3s conditioning video, only the model-generated 5 seconds.

**Example command to trim your videos using ffmpeg:**

This example is based on cropping to the first 5 seconds which is useful for I2V; for V2V please adapt this command if the generated videos include the 3s conditioning part.
```bash
# Create output directory for trimmed videos
mkdir -p generated_videos_5s

# Trim all videos to 5 seconds at desired frame rate
# Adjust the `-r 24` parameter to match your desired FPS (e.g. 8, 16, 24, or 30)
for v in generated_video_path/*.mp4; do
  ffmpeg -y -i "$v" \
    -t 5 \
    -r 24 \
    "generated_videos_5s/$(basename "$v")"
done
```

## Step B: Evaluating Generated Videos on Physics-IQ to Generate Benchmark Scores

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

System requirements: tested on Linux; requires command `ffprobe` to be available (install if necessary, e.g. `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`).

### 2. Dataset Placement

- Ensure you have downloaded and placed the `physics-iq-benchmark` dataset in your working directory. This dataset must include 30FPS videos and optionally your desired FPS. If your desired FPS does not exist in our dataset already, it will be automatically generated. You should have the following structure:

```plaintext
physics-IQ-benchmark/
├── full-videos/
│   └── ...
|
├── split-videos/
│   ├── conditioning-videos/
│   │   └── 30FPS/
│   │       ├── 0001_conditioning-videos_30FPS_perspective-left_take-1_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.mp4
│   │       ├── 0002_conditioning-videos_30FPS_perspective-center_take-1_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.mp4
│   │       └── ...
│   └── testing-videos/
│       └── 30FPS/
│           ├── 0001_testing-videos_30FPS_perspective-left_take-1_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.mp4
│           ├── 0002_testing-videos_30FPS_perspective-center_take-1_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.mp4
│           └── ...
├── switch-frames/
│   ├── 0001_switch-frames_anyFPS_perspective-left_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.jpg
│   ├── 0002_switch-frames_anyFPS_perspective-center_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.jpg
│   └── ...
└── video-masks/
    └── real/
        └── 30FPS/
            ├── 0001_video-masks_30FPS_perspective-left_take-1_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.mp4
            ├── 0002_video-masks_30FPS_perspective-center_take-1_trimmed-ball-and-block-fall.mp4
            └── ...
```

- the descriptions file which includes all file names and descriptions of the scenarios should be placed in your home directory as `descriptions.csv`.
- Place your generated videos under `.model_name` directory.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Note that this script evaluates the **first 5 seconds** of your generated videos. Hence, make sure these are the 5 seconds generated right after the switch frame.

### 3. Generate benchmark scores and plots

```bash
python3 code/run_physics_iq.py --input_folders <generated_videos_dirs> --output_folder <output_dir> --descriptions_file <descriptions_file>
```
**Parameters:**
- `--input_folders`: The path to the directories containing input videos (in `.mp4` format), with one directory per model (`/model_name/video.mp4`).
- `--output_folder`: The path to the directory where output CSV files will be saved.
- `--descriptions_file`: The path to the `descriptions.csv` file.
